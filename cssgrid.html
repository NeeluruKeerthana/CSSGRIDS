        Grid Layout is a new layout model for CSS that has powerful abilities 
        to control the sizing and positioning of boxes and their contents.
        Unlike Flexible Box Layout, which is single-axis–oriented, 
        grid Layout is optimized for 2-dimensional layouts: those in
        which alignment of content is desired in both dimensions.
        In addition, due to its ability to explicitly position items 
        in the grid, Grid Layout allows dramatic transformations in 
        visual layout structure without requiring corresponding markup 
        changes. By combining media queries with the CSS properties that 
        control layout of the grid container and its children, authors can adapt 
        their layout to changes in device form factors, orientation, and available 
        space, while preserving a more ideal semantic structuring of their content across presentations.

        Although many layouts can be expressed with either Grid or Flexbox, they each have their
        specialties. Grid enforces 2-dimensional alignment, uses a top-down approach to layout, 
        allows explicit overlapping of items, and has more powerful spanning capabilities. Flexbox 
        focuses on space distribution within an axis, uses a simpler bottom-up approach to layout,
        can use a content-size–based line-wrapping system to control its secondary axis, and relies 
        on the underlying markup hierarchy to build more complex layouts. It is expected that both will
        be valuable and complementary tools for CSS authors.

        <h4>Background and Motivation</h4>
        As websites evolved from simple documents into complex, interactive applications, techniques 
        for document layout, e.g. floats, were not necessarily well suited for application layout.
        By using a combination of tables, JavaScript, or careful measurements on floated elements,
        authors discovered workarounds to achieve desired layouts. Layouts that adapted to the available
        space were often brittle and resulted in counter-intuitive behavior as space became constrained.
        As an alternative, authors of many web applications opted for a fixed layout that cannot take advantage
        of changes in the available rendering space on a screen.

        The capabilities of grid layout address these problems. It provides a mechanism for authors to divide available
        space for layout into columns and rows using a set of predictable sizing behaviors. Authors can then precisely 
        position and size the building block elements of their application into the grid areas defined by the intersections 
        of these columns and rows. The following examples illustrate the adaptive capabilities of grid layout, and how it allows a cleaner
        separation of content and style.

        <h4>Adapting Layouts to Available Space</h4>
        Grid layout can be used to intelligently resize elements within a webpage. The adjacent figures
         represent a game with five major
         components in the layout: the game title, stats area, game board, score area, and control area.
